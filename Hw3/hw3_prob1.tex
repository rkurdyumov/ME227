\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
Max speed @ $1g$ lateral acceleration:
$$\frac{v^2}{r} = g \Rightarrow v_{max} = \sqrt{rg}$$
Therefore, we have:

Inside: $v_{max} = \sqrt{Rg} = 31.3m/s$

Outside: $v_{max} = \sqrt{(R+w)g} = 35.7m/s$

Racing: $v_{max} =\sqrt{(R+w)g} = 35.7m/s$

\subsection{Derivation}
We know distance travelled is $d = r\theta$.  For the inside and outside tracks, $\theta = \pi$.
We can calculate $\theta$ for the racing track by examining the illustrated curve.
We can draw a right triangle with hypotenuse $R+w$ and vertical side $w$, with $\theta$ between them.
Therefore, $cos\theta = \frac{w}{R+w}$, or:
$$\theta_{racing} = 2\arccos{\frac{w}{R+w}}$$
So we have:

Inside: $d = {\pi}R = 314m$

Outside: $d = {\pi}(R+w) = 408m$

Racing: $d = {(2\arccos{\frac{w}{R+w}}})(R+w) = 348m$

\subsection{Time through the curve}
We know $t = \frac{d}{v_{max}}$, so:

Inside: $t = {\pi}\sqrt\frac{R}{g} = 10.0s$

Outside: $t = {\pi}\sqrt\frac{R+w}{g} = 11.4s$

Racing: $t = 2\arccos{\frac{w}{R+w}}\sqrt\frac{R+w}{g} = 9.74s$

\subsection{Which line to choose}
The racing line has the fastest time.  The racing line and outside line have the fastest exit speed.
So I would choose the racing line.

\subsection{Limitations}
The transition from a straight section to a constant radius curve requires an instantaneous step change in steering angle,
which is impossible to accomplish in reality.
